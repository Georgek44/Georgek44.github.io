### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time we expressed the idea of drawing with coding. I remember reading the instructions for the lab and being confused as to how it would be possible to make such a program. However I felt very accomplished when I figured out it would be possible with just multiple loops. 


* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 3 was the first of my favorites. I enjoyed how we got to revisit this topic in the future and make our code more advanced. This was the first time we expressed the idea of making games with our code, and while very simple the application of such an idea is very promising. 


* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 3 was also one of my favorites because we got to play animations with our code. We also got to use ifstream to read the animations from other files allowing our code to run multiple different animations. I feel like this lab was where the coding really started to feel like I could apply it to tasks outside my class.
